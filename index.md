# Fifth Annual UK Systems Research Challenges Workshop, November-December, 2020, Virtual Seminar Series

This is the fifth iteration of a workshop bringing together systems researchers
from across the UK and beyond, to discuss pressing topics affecting the design
and implementation of large-scale systems in a friendly and inclusive setting.

Past topics have included everything from system security and architecture, to
consensus and engineering, to data visualisation, data centres and the Internet
of Things. We aim to be broad and inclusive -- if it's a matter that has bearing
on how we design, build, operate and use large-scale computing systems, it's in
scope.

<b> Due to COVID-19 disruption, we are running the UK Systems Research Challenges Workshop as a virtual seminar series. Please see program below. </b>

## ~~Call for Presentations~~

**Submissions are now closed -- see the list of [accepted talks](initial-program.txt).**

We invite you to submit 500 word / 0.5 page abstracts (PDF or plain text) of
work for presentation at the next UK Systems Research Challenges workshop. In
most cases the main points to include in the abstract are the problem being
solved, the new idea or hypothesis being explored in your work, and the current
state of the project (e.g., whether you are looking for feedback on an early
idea or presenting finished results that others might want to use).

We're interested in presentations that speak to:

  * innovative mechanisms
  * lessons learned: experience with large or unusual systems
  * a viewpoint on a controversial systems topic
  * a big problem coming over the horizon

and really, anything that would be of interest to the builders of computer
systems.

This is an informal workshop without published proceedings. Work is not subject
to detailed peer review; we are requesting abstracts only to help us put
together the programme and confirm that work is on-topic. In the event of an
excess of submissions, preference for presentation slots will be given to Ph.D.
students and early career researchers.
