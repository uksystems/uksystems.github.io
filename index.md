# Welcome!

This is the website for the UK research community, academic and industrial,
interested in problems relating generally to computer systems. That includes
both traditional systems topics such as operating systems, distributed systems
and networking, and more current challenges and approaches at scales from edge
and mobile computing to datacenter and the cloud. If your work has bearing on
how we should go about building, deploying and operating practical computer
systems, it's of interest!

The [Seventh iteration of the workshop](/workshop/2023/) is now live!

Please consider [submitting your 500 word
abstract](https://syswrk2023.hotcrp.com/).

This is an informal workshop for the community where we can discuss work
addressing current and future challenges in systems computing.
[Submissions](https://syswrk2023.hotcrp.com/) are typically in the form of a
short 0.5pp / 500 word abstracts which, after a light review process focused on
ensuring relevance, lead to a presentation (typically 15min) plus Q&A at the
workshop. In the event that too many submissions are received, preference is
given to Ph.D. students and Early Career Researchers. Both UK and international
participants are very welcome!

Details of previous workshops are [available here](/workshop).
