Abstract
--------
Verification of functional correctness of control programs is
an essential task for the development of space electronics; it is difficult
and time-consuming and typically outweighs design and programming
tasks in terms of development hours. We present a verification approach
designed to help spacecraft engineers reduce the effort required for formal
verification of low-level control programs executed on custom hardware.
The approach uses a metalanguage to describe the semantics of a program
as a state transformer, which can be compiled to multiple targets
for testing, formal verification, and code generation. The metalanguage
itself is embedded in a strongly-typed host language (Haskell), providing
a way to prove program properties at the type level, which can shorten
the feedback loop and further increase the productivity of engineers.
The verification approach is demonstrated on an industrial case study.
We present REDFIN, a processing core used in space missions, and its
formal semantics expressed using the proposed metalanguage, followed
by a detailed example of verification of a simple control program.
Keywords: formal verification, instruction set architecture, functional
programming, domain-specific languages.
