Abstract
--------
Automatic optimisation, control, and defence of networks are at last becoming commonplace. Data-driven networking has led the charge in traffic optimisation, congestion control and packet classification via adaptive techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), where every change and its measured effects further improve future decisions. Considering that the network evolves in its use and deployed protocols, this flexibility is essential. Yet data-driven methods suffer from a key weakness: they are dependent on both the recency and accuracy of input state. An out-of-date view of the world will lead to suboptimal choices, as will long processing times. These can result in worse performance and slower adaptation to the evolving network.

Programmable data-planes and in-switch compute, then, hold promise for integrating these new techniques in a feasible and efficient manner (beyond dedicated servers or virtualised network functions). For RL, key tasks include policy evaluation, online training, state collection, and action execution -- each of these introduces some degree of sensitivity to state accuracy. Ideally then, all logic would run on these programmable devices. Yet, there is often a finite budget in microcode/FPGA space, per-packet processing times, and available cores for execution. Moreover, necessary hardware, such as floating-point units, is unavailable in almost all cases.

The precise costs and trade-offs which operators and designers must make have yet to be identified. This follows from a design space explosion induced by many necessary workarounds. For instance, quantisation or fixed-point arithmetic will allow training and control on all devices, but introduces further questions: what degree of quantisation is most appropriate? What effect would this have on training accuracy, communications cost, or storage requirements? More concerns arise when we consider core allocation, local vs. distributed training, and reliable lightweight communication in multi-agent scenarios. In all cases, network operators will not consider tools which affect underlying traffic.

I aim to examine the effects of these choices on an existing RL-based DDoS attack mitigation system. To protect legitimate traffic, this controls packet drop and filtering for each flow using individual metrics observed by RL agents at ingress routers, and load measurements from several points along the path taken by the flow in question. The examined metrics include the throughput and latency of its individual components alongside system metrics: flow arrival-to-judgement time, and knowledge propagation time. Beyond this, it's crucial to identify what we can implement on pure P4-capable hardware. While extensions to P4 are fairly common in commodity hardware, the need for full design access (as in NetFPGA) or Micro-C (as in Netronome SmartNICs) represent a break from the clean, loop-free semantics of P4. As the market matures, these may represent different feature classes and price points.

I will discuss early development efforts (including challenges and results) on the Netronome Agilio SmartNIC, which supports the P4 language as well as some degree of arbitrary microcode. I intend to present how reinforcement learning execution and network telemetry will differ in the above metrics when compared to a vNF-based deployment (i.e., software on external commodity servers).
