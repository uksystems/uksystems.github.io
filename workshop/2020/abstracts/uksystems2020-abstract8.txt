Abstract
--------
Traditional parallelising compilers e.g. ICC, Clang/Polly, GCC/Graphite
parallelise loops by building parallel schedules while respecting all
sequential data dependencies. This process is code-centric and applied
on a loop-by-loop basis, ignoring the rest of the program, and is
particular to the semantic intentions of any data structures used in the
loops. With the Data-Centric Parallelisation (DCP) project, we aim to
replicate the holistic approach of the human expert, taking into account
the context of the whole program and knowledge of the most commonly
known abstract data types and their implementations.

Our main aim is to develop a novel "data-first" paradigm for automatic
parallelisation of sequential legacy code, outperforming existing
parallelising compilers on irregular, pointer based or control flow
dominated applications.

As a motivating example, consider a program that sequentially traverses
and increments each element in a simple singly-linked list. Traditional
parallelising compilers are unable to parallelise such a program, as
they are unaware of the context of the complete program. We observe that
the program is traversing over a linked list and **increase the level of
abstraction** e.g. to a set if we observe that the element operations
are independent of each other and traversal order, and now our loop is
trivially and perfectly parallelisable.

This linked list example is naive, but important. Hand-implemented
linked lists are commonly found in legacy and scientific code, and
library implementations are often used needlessly. Similar
pointer-chasing code is often used to implement graph structures. This
is conceptually convenient, but again makes parallelisation and
sequential optimisation difficult. Graph data structures are commonly
used in data science and network analysis. Software and hardware
techniques for accelerating graph programs is an open research problem,
and there are several popular and high-performance graph libraries
available.

In this talk, I will give an overview of the DCP project, discussing the
background, motivation and our planned approach to the problem, along
with some early results. I will also discuss my planned work applying
the principles of DCP to the domain of graph data structures.
