Abstract
--------
Standards documents have been slow to adopt packet description formalisms that
go beyond the limited syntax that can be captured in packet header diagrams. As
increasingly complex protocols, like QUIC, are standardised, this is becoming
problematic: descriptions of packet formats are often fragmented, incomplete,
and difficult to follow, and buggy implementations, that do not conform to the
specification, are likely to result.

In this talk, I will describe an abstract, intermediate packet representation,
that fully captures the syntax of packet formats, can be generated from a range
of packet description languages, and can generate packet parser code. By
specifying an intermediate representation that can be produced from both
existing and novel packet descriptions, we hope to encourage use of more
expressive, machine readable, packet descriptions in protocol standards. The
design and adoption of such an intermediate representation gives rise to a
number of interesting technical and social challenges: I will discuss these
challenges, and the solutions developed so far, and seek feedback from the
community.
