Submission #4: Designing Transport-Level Encryption for Datacenter Networks
===========================================================================

Abstract
--------
Cloud applications need network data encryption to isolate from other tenants and protect their data from potential eavesdroppers in the network infrastructure. This paper presents SDT, a protocol design for emerging datacenter transport protocols, such as NDP and Homa, to integrate data encryption. SDT enables an new design point of transport- level encryption that supports a existing NIC offloading designed for TLS over TCP, new protocol number other than TCP and UDP, and message-based abstraction that enables various in-network compute and host stack load balancing.
