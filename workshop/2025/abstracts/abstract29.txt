Submission #29: The Case for OS-Level Website Fingerprinting Protection
=======================================================================

Abstract
--------
We argue the need for generic OS-level
protection against Website Fingerprinting Attacks. We believe the OS kernel is the
right place to implement such a protection framework because of two reasons. First, the OS is where the major WF
attack surfaces, such as packet size and timing, are ultimately
created. In addition to packet scheduling described earlier,
the TCP implementation makes a decision about how the
application-level bytestream is segmented into the packets
through the generic segmentation offload interface at the
lower layer. Second, the OS kernel has visibility and control
of the traffic sent or received by all the transport protocol
implementations running in the host, whereas individual
ones do not have that. This could create opportunities of
making the host traffic more robust against WF attacks by
making the obfuscation decision based on other co-existing
traffic.

Our early results show that, based on the k-FP model, the state-of-the-art WFA algorithm, just  adding as little delay as 0.25 ms to the base RTT of 0.20 ms has a significant impact on the accuracy of the attack, indicating the feasibility of OS-level traffic manipulation to prevent WFAs.
