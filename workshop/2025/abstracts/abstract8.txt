Submission #8: Understanding how to implement sparse matrix operations efficiently
==================================================================================

Abstract
--------
Lots of modern software is built around linear algebra, for
scientific computing, machine learning, AI, or realistic
immersive graphics. But we are increasingly encountering /sparse/
matrices which require completely different technology than the
GPU acceleration that has been applied so successfully to dense
matrices. In this talk we will explore the challenges involved
in making efficient the inherently irregular calculations and
storage involved in manipulating sparse matrices. This involves
addressing several systems problems simultaneously in the
relationships between programs, cores, caches, and memory.
