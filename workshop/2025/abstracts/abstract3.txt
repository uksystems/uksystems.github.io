Submission #3: A Data-Plane-Only Approach to Accurate Persistent Flow Detection on Programmable
Switches in High-Speed Networks
================================================================================================

Abstract
--------
In high-speed data center networks, persistent flows are repeatedly observed over extended periods, potentially signaling threats such as stealthy DDoS or botnet attacks. Monitoring every flow in production-grade hardware switches that feature limited memory, however, is challenging under typical high flow rates and data volumes. To tackle this, approximate data structures—i.e., sketches—are often employed in cutting-edge programmable switches. Yet many existing methods rely on per-time-window flag resets, which require frequent control-plane interventions that make them unsuitable for high-speed traffic. This paper introduces Pallas, a fully data-plane-implementable sketch for detecting persistent flows in high-speed networks with high accuracy.
