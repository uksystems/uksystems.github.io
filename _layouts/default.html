            This is the website for the UK research community, academic and
            industrial, interested in problems relating generally to computer
            systems. That includes both the more traditional topics such as
            operating systems, distributed systems and networking, as well as
            more current challenges and approaches at scales from edge and mobile
            computing to datacenter and the cloud. If your work has bearing on how
            we should go about building practical computer systems, it's of
            interest!
          </p>
          <p>
            We organise an annual community workshop</a>, held in beautiful County Durham<!--Thanks Nigel-->, to share recent results,
            work-in-progress, challenges, and other matters of interest.
